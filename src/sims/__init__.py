"""
Monte Carlo simulations for DRT Platinum.

Each script in this package:
- is executable as `python -m src.sims.<name>`
- writes machine-readable output to results/
- does NOT generate figures directly

Simulation scripts are intentionally simple and parameterized
for robustness across environments.
