# DRT_distinguishability-rate-theory
Distinguishability Rate Theory (DRT) — a journal-grade research project studying operational and information-theoretic limits of time and phase resolution.  The framework derives minimal resolvable scales from Fisher information, distinguishability thresholds, and noise constraints, without assuming ontological discreteness.
