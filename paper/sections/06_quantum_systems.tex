\section{Quantum Systems}
\label{sec:quantum_systems}

This section applies Distinguishability-Rate Theory (DRT) to quantum-mechanical
settings.
The goal is twofold:
(i) to show that a broad class of quantum ``limits'' are operational consequences
of bounded distinguishability rates, and
(ii) to isolate precisely those constraints that are \emph{not} reducible to
local Fisher or quantum Fisher information (QFI) geometry and therefore require
additional non-epistemic structure.
Throughout, we enforce a strict classification between inference-limited
(QFI-reducible) bounds and genuinely non-Fisher-reducible constraints.

\subsection{Quantum Fisher information as an epistemic ceiling}

Let $\rho_\theta$ be a quantum statistical model encoding a parameter $\theta$.
The quantum Fisher information $\QFI(\theta)$ is defined as the supremum of the
classical Fisher information over all admissible measurements on $\rho_\theta$.
Operationally, $\QFI(\theta)$ characterizes the maximal \emph{local}
(quadratic) distinguishability permitted by quantum mechanics per effective use
of the model.

To interface with DRT, it is essential to distinguish between:
(i) the local geometric quantity $\QFI(\theta)$, and
(ii) the \emph{protocol- and channel-dependent} accumulated quantity
$\FI_T^{Q}(\theta)$, defined as the maximal Fisher information
\emph{operationally achievable over an observation window $T$}
under a specified class of quantum measurement channels, including sampling,
control, and noise constraints.
In DRT language, $\FI_T^{Q}(\theta)$ represents a quantum distinguishability
budget, not an intrinsic property of the parameter alone.

\begin{proposition}[QFI as supremum over Fisher information]
\label{prop:qfi_supremum}
For any admissible measurement strategy applied to $\rho_\theta$ within a fixed
quantum observation channel class, the accumulated classical Fisher information
satisfies
\[
\FI_T(\theta) \;\le\; \FI_T^{Q}(\theta).
\]
Equality is achievable only for measurements optimally matched to the local
eigenstructure of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and compatible with the
channel constraints.
\end{proposition}

\paragraph{Assumptions.}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(Q1)] Valid quantum statistical model $\rho_\theta$;
\item[(Q2)] admissible measurements obey quantum measurement postulates and the
declared channel constraints;
\item[(Q3)] local (quadratic) distinguishability geometry in the regime of
interest.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
Any resolution bound expressible solely in terms of $\FI_T^{Q}(\theta)$ constrains
\emph{inference} under a specified quantum observation channel.
Such a bound is epistemic in the DRT sense and does not, by itself, impose an
ontological restriction on the parameter $\theta$.

Combining Proposition~\ref{prop:qfi_supremum} with the operational decision
criterion yields
\begin{equation}
\delta\theta_{\min}
\;\ge\;
\sqrt{\frac{2\Dstar}{\FI_T^{Q}(\theta)}} ,
\label{eq:qfi_operational_bound}
\end{equation}
formally identical to the classical bound with $\FI_T$ replaced by
$\FI_T^{Q}$.

\subsection{Mandelstam--Tamm as a rate-limited inequality}

Consider unitary parameter encoding
$\rho_t = e^{-iHt}\rho_0 e^{iHt}$ with generator $H$.
Unless stated otherwise, we work in units $\hbar=1$.

For such unitary families, the quantum Fisher information for the time parameter
satisfies
\[
\QFI(t) = 4\,\mathrm{Var}_{\rho_0}(H)\, t^2
\qquad
(\text{equivalently } \QFI(t)=4\,\mathrm{Var}_{\rho_0}(H)\, t^2/\hbar^2).
\]

\begin{proposition}[Mandelstam--Tamm as distinguishability-rate bound]
\label{prop:mt_as_rate}
The Mandelstam--Tamm inequality is QFI-reducible:
it follows from the maximal local distinguishability rate set by the generator
variance $\mathrm{Var}_{\rho_0}(H)$.
Consequently, it is epistemic in the sense of DRT.
\end{proposition}

\paragraph{Assumptions.}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(M1)] Unitary parameter encoding generated by $H$;
\item[(M2)] finite generator variance $\mathrm{Var}_{\rho_0}(H)$;
\item[(M3)] absence of additional decoherence beyond the declared unitary channel.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Derivation (one line).}
Substituting $\FI_T^{Q}(t)=\QFI(t)$ into
Eq.~\eqref{eq:qfi_operational_bound} yields
\[
\delta t_{\min} \ge \frac{\sqrt{2\Dstar}}{2\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(H)}}
\qquad
(\text{or } \delta t_{\min} \ge
\hbar\sqrt{2\Dstar}/[2\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(H)}]).
\]
This is precisely the operational content of the Mandelstam--Tamm inequality in
DRT form.
\hfill$\square$

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
Within DRT, Mandelstam--Tamm constrains the \emph{rate at which
distinguishability can accumulate} under a specified unitary observation channel.
It does not assert a fundamental quantum of time or an ontological bound on
temporal resolution.

\subsection{Decoherence and meeting-point structure}

In realistic quantum systems, decoherence suppresses distinguishability rates.
Let ${\DistRate}^{Q}(t;\theta)$ denote the instantaneous quantum
distinguishability rate.
A generic noise envelope takes the form
\begin{equation}
{\DistRate}^{Q}(t;\theta)
\;\le\;
{\DistRate}^{Q,\mathrm{ideal}}(t)\,e^{-2\Gamma t},
\label{eq:qfi_noise_envelope}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is an effective decoherence or noise rate.
Integration yields saturation of $\FI_T^{Q}(\theta)$, directly analogous to the
classical noise-limited bound of
Section~\ref{sec:rate_limited_bounds}.

As a consequence, there exists an optimal interrogation time at which
distinguishability accumulation is maximized.
This ``meeting-point'' between inference-limited and dynamics-limited regimes is
illustrated for Ramsey interferometry
(Figure~\ref{fig:ramsey}) and Mach--Zehnder interferometry with finite visibility
(Figure~\ref{fig:mzi}).
The frozen numerical data serve as numerical consistency checks of the declared
rate envelopes and observation models; they are not independent inference
evidence.

\subsection{Classification of quantum bounds}

We now formalize the epistemic--ontological separation.

\begin{theorem}[QFI-reducible quantum bounds]
\label{thm:qfi_reducible}
Any resolution bound derivable solely from an upper bound on local quantum Fisher
information accumulation (equivalently, from an envelope on
${\DistRate}^{Q}$) is epistemic.
Such bounds constrain inference under a specified observation channel and must
relax under controlled increases of distinguishability rate within that channel
class.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}[Additional-structure-dependent bounds]
\label{prop:ml_status}
Bounds requiring assumptions beyond local QFI geometry—such as global spectral
constraints, reference-energy assumptions, or nonlocal compatibility
conditions—are not purely Fisher/QFI-reducible.
Their validity depends explicitly on this additional structure and therefore lies
outside rate-limited inference alone.
\end{proposition}

\paragraph{Example.}
Margolus--Levitin-type bounds rely on global energy constraints (e.g.\ a reference
to a ground-state energy) and do not arise from local Fisher or QFI geometry or
distinguishability-rate limitations alone.

\begin{lemma}[Non-Fisher-reducible quantum constraints]
\label{lem:non_fisher_quantum}
Constraints originating from non-classical event algebra, contextuality, or
global compatibility conditions cannot be reduced to local Fisher or QFI geometry.
They do not relax under controlled increases of distinguishability rate within any
fixed local-inference framework and therefore represent non-epistemic structure.
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Examples.}
Bell and Kochen--Specker constraints fall into this class.

\subsection{Noise as a universal suppressor}

Noise and decoherence universally suppress distinguishability rates in quantum
systems.
The exponential envelopes in Eq.~\eqref{eq:qfi_noise_envelope} mirror the
noise-limited bounds of
Section~\ref{sec:rate_limited_bounds}, explaining the structural universality of
rate-limited inference across classical and quantum domains.

\subsection{Falsifiability}

The epistemic classification advanced in this section is falsifiable.
Observation of sustained Fisher or quantum Fisher information accumulation
exceeding the declared rate envelopes—without modification of the observation
channel or introduction of additional degrees of freedom—would refute the
rate-limited description for the corresponding quantum system.

\subsection{Summary}

Quantum systems do not invalidate DRT.
They provide a setting in which the boundary between inference-limited and
non-epistemic constraints can be drawn sharply.
Local QFI-reducible bounds are epistemic; genuinely non-classical constraints
require additional global or algebraic structure.
This prepares the ground for the explicit analysis of ontological residues in the
next section.
