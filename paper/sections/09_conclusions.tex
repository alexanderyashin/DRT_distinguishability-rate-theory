\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This work introduced \emph{Distinguishability Rate Theory} (DRT) as an operational
framework for analyzing limits of temporal, phase, and parameter resolution.
The central result is that a broad and heterogeneous class of reported bounds
arises from finite rates of distinguishability accumulation imposed by a given
observation channel, rather than from microscopic dynamics or ontological
structure.

\subsection{Established results}

The analysis establishes the following results.

\paragraph{Inference as the operative constraint.}
Operational resolution is governed by the accumulation of Fisher or quantum
Fisher information under finite statistics, noise, correlations, and bandwidth.
Whenever distinguishability accumulates at a bounded rate, resolution limits
follow as a direct and unavoidable consequence.

\paragraph{Universality of rate-limited scalings.}
Self-consistent rate arguments yield universal scaling laws, including the
$\Flux^{-1/3}$ bound for photon-limited diffusion and its generalization to
anomalous transport.
These scalings depend exclusively on coarse features of the observation channel
and are independent of microscopic details of the underlying dynamics.

\paragraph{Non-\iid\ inference as a distinct regime.}
Continuous monitoring and correlated data streams constitute a qualitatively
distinct inference regime.
In such settings, information is encoded in temporal correlations, leading to
correlation-limited accumulation and linear-in-time asymptotics that cannot be
circumvented by increased sampling density alone.

\paragraph{Necessary and sufficient epistemic--ontological boundary.}
Quantum systems do not invalidate the rate-limited framework.
Resolution bounds reducible to local (quantum) Fisher information are epistemic
and vanish under epistemic exhaustion.
Constraints that persist under epistemic exhaustion—such as those arising from
non-classical event structure—constitute genuine ontological residues.
This criterion is both necessary and sufficient and provides a principled
stopping rule for inference-based arguments.

\subsection{Conceptual contribution}

Beyond individual bounds, the primary contribution of DRT is conceptual.
It supplies a precise diagnostic criterion for determining whether a claimed
limit reflects inference under finite resources or encodes irreducible
structural content of the theory.
By enforcing this distinction, DRT prevents the systematic misinterpretation of
operational limits as statements about the nature of time, phase, or physical
reality.

\subsection{Relation to existing approaches}

DRT does not replace estimation theory, quantum metrology, or foundational
analysis.
Instead, it reorganizes their results around a single operational primitive:
the rate of distinguishability accumulation.
This reorganization clarifies the assumptions and regimes under which familiar
bounds apply and explains their common origin across classical and quantum
domains.

\subsection{Explicit limitations}

The present work is intentionally restricted to local distinguishability
geometry and explicitly specified observation channels.
DRT does not address global state-space constraints, non-classical event
algebra, or foundational structures that lie outside inference theory.
Such features appear exclusively as ontological residues and require
independent theoretical treatment.

\subsection{Outlook}

Future extensions may refine, but cannot overturn, the core results established
here.
Multi-parameter inference, adaptive strategies, and strongly non-Markovian
environments can be incorporated as modifications of distinguishability-rate
envelopes.
These developments extend the regime map without altering the
epistemic--ontological boundary.

\subsection{Final statement}

Distinguishability Rate Theory reclassifies limits of resolution as statements
about information flow rather than statements about the structure of reality.
By identifying which constraints are inference-limited and which are genuinely
ontological, it provides a unified operational language across classical and
quantum systems and delineates a precise boundary beyond which inference-based
reasoning cannot proceed.
