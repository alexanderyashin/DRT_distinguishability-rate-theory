## Paper Structure — Canonical Mapping

**Title:**

**Layer:** Ontology of Continua — Extensions, K₂  
**Evidence Pack:** PLATINUM (frozen)  
**Status:** Architecture approved, generation in progress

## Purpose of this document

This file serves as a **single-source structural map** of the paper.
It defines:

- the logical role of each section,
- the dependency between sections,
- the correspondence between analytical results and the frozen evidence pack.

This document is **not** part of the compiled PDF.
It exists to allow any future agent or reviewer to reconstruct intent,
scope, and ordering without additional context.

## Section-by-section mapping

### 00 — Extended Abstract (`sections/00_abstract.tex`)
**Role:**  
High-level operational summary for expert readers.

**Function:**  
- State the core claim: many temporal bounds are epistemic.
- Introduce distinguishability growth as the organizing primitive.
- Explicitly announce the epistemic–ontological boundary.

---

### 01 — Introduction (`sections/01_introduction.tex`)
**Role:**  
Problem framing and motivation.

**Function:**  
- Critically review common interpretations of temporal bounds.
- Identify the conflation of inference limits with ontology.
- Define the scope and limits of the present contribution.

---

### 02 — Operational Framework (`sections/02_operational_framework.tex`)
**Role:**  
Foundational definitions and language.

**Function:**  
- Define distinguishability operationally.
- Introduce distinguishability rate and decision thresholds.
- Establish the inference-first perspective used throughout.

---

### 03 — Rate-Limited Bounds (`sections/03_rate_limited_bounds.tex`)
**Role:**  
Core theoretical engine of the paper.

**Function:**  
- Derive general rate-limited bounds.

### 05 — Continuous Monitoring (`sections/05_continuous_monitoring.tex`)
**Role:**  
Bridge between classical and quantum regimes.

**Function:**  
- Analyze continuous observation as an information channel.
- Show how monitoring rate, not dynamics, sets limits.
- Prepare the ground for quantum applications.

---

### 06 — Quantum Systems (`sections/06_quantum_systems.tex`)
**Role:**  
Quantum-mechanical instantiation.

**Function:**  
- Analyze Ramsey interferometry and open quantum systems.
- Use QFI to separate epistemic and ontological constraints.
- Identify regimes where quantum structure is unavoidable.

---

### 07 — Ontological Residues (`sections/07_ontological_residues.tex`)
**Role:**  
Conceptual resolution.

**Function:**  
- Define the epistemic–ontological boundary precisely.
- Identify residual bounds robust to improved inference.
- Clarify what remains genuinely “quantum”.

---

### 08 — Implications and Falsifiability (`sections/08_implications_falsifiability.tex`)
**Role:**  
Scientific accountability.

**Function:**  
- Propose falsifiable predictions.
- Describe experimental discrimination strategies.
- Connect to metrology and foundations.

---

### 09 — Conclusions (`sections/09_conclusions.tex`)
